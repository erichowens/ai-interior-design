# Quick Guide to AI Interior Design Tools

## If You Just Want to Try One:

### üèÜ Start with RoomGPT
- **Why**: It's free for 3 renders, takes 25 seconds, no BS
- **Link**: roomgpt.io
- **Best for**: Getting a feel for what AI can do

## Based on What You Need:

### "I'm redecorating my apartment"
‚Üí **Use Paintit.ai or DecorMatters**
- They link to actual furniture you can buy
- Upload your room photo, get shopping links

### "I'm selling my house"  
‚Üí **Use REimagine Home or Interior AI**
- Specialized in virtual staging
- Makes empty rooms look furnished

### "I'm a design student/professional"
‚Üí **Use HomeStyler (free) or Foyr Neo (paid)**
- Real CAD export
- Professional features
- Industry standard tools

### "I just want to play around"
‚Üí **Use Planner 5D**
- 85M+ downloads, huge community
- Free tier is actually usable
- Good mobile app

## Red Flags to Avoid:
- Anything over $50/month unless you're a pro
- "Per room" pricing (gets expensive fast)
- No free trial = skip it

## The Truth:
- They all do basically the same thing
- Free tiers are usually enough for personal use
- The "AI" is mostly Stable Diffusion under the hood
- Upload photo ‚Üí Choose style ‚Üí Get redesign

## My Personal Take:
Most people should just use **RoomGPT** (fast, free) or **HomeStyler** (Autodesk quality, free tier). Only pay if you need:
- Unlimited renders
- High resolution exports
- Commercial use rights
- API access

## Quick Test:
1. Take a photo of your room
2. Try RoomGPT's free renders
3. If you like it, then explore others

That's it. Don't overthink it.
